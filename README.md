## Covid Question-Answer AI 

![Covid Search Image 1](https://github.com/Jacky2Wong/Covid-Research/blob/master/images/covid_search_1.png)

Tired of fake news and having to read lots of papers, we decided to help many large organisations/small businesses 
navigate these hard times by building an AI question and answer engine on top of research papers showing direct quotes and linking to papers that were referenced. 

We recommend people do their research before believing whatever is said on CNN/blogs/articles/WeChat.

This has been built on top of a lot of open-source software and could not have been done without it.
